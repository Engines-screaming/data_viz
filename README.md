# Data Vizualization - Project 6

### Summary 

 The data used for this visualization is the Baseball dataset. The data includes a player's height, weight, handedness, home runs, and batting average. I created this data visualization to emphasize the main idea of this data set: that right handed batters have better batting averages than left or ambidextrous batters.

### Design

The initial design was to include a task bar with my name, a graph title, and a graph. The base web page was taken from a bootstrap template so that I could focus more on data visualizations and less on HTML/CSS. My idea is to plot a bubble chart of height vs weight, with the bubble size to correspond to batting average. The graph will be faceted on handedness so that you can compare the locations where size is bigger for each handedness. The handedness has the biggest circles will show that they are the better performing handedness.
