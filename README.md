# Data Vizualization - Project 6

### Summary 

This data visualization project shows differences among the performance of baseball players in the Baseball dataset. 


### Design

I created the base webpage using Bootstrap since it allows for beautiful pages, and allows me to focus more on the data visualization aspect of this project instead of the HTML/CSS portion.
